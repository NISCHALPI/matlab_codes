# Matlab Projects
These are my matlab projects for my DiffEq and Linear Class.

Mass-Spring.m -> I solved second degree mass-spring system for different initial condition and plotted it.

Cryptography -> I used matrix to encode and decode cryptic message.

MatrixWorks -> Used Matrix Diagonlization techniques learned in my linear class.
